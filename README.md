# Scandi EuroVOC

This repo contains code for easily selecting Swedish and Danish entries from Eurovoc and pushing them to a Huggingface repository.
Start in a clean environment, then run
```bash
bash run_all.sh
```
This will log you into your Huggingface account, fetch the data, curate, then push.
